# open.models Loader

## Get Started

How to use open.models Loader? It's Simple!

* To use open.models Loader is necessary have installed xampp (or wampp)

* Step One : Copy or cut `web-php` to your webserver directory (in case of xampp / windows, try `C://xampp/htdocs/`)
* Step Two : Open.The Browser and go to : `127.0.0.1/web-php/`. WARNING: Notice "single.htm" file don't exists yet
* Step Three : Upload how much files you want (Personal advice, don't try to upload more then 1000)
* Step Four : In your Filterscript or gamemode, use `#include <openmodels>` after `AFTER a_samp` and `a_mysql`
* Step Five : compile your script and enjoy!

## Advices

* File `single.htm` doesn't exist **yet**, so you only can upload files with baseid 0 (By The Way, in index.php you can change, or change manually by the database)

* newids are auto generated by the system, so you can't change or define one (in the future will be possible, but not right now, pay attention tu future releases if necessary)

* This System was developed to localhost uses, so if you try to run in one host or vps, maybe don't will work (Help Us to make it compatible if you can!)
